# Stat545 Assignment 5: Factor and Figure Management

This is my submission for assignment 5 of the 2018 iteration of the Stat545 course at UBC.

In the previous assignment we focused on reshaping and joining datasets to prepare them for specific analyses. In this assignment we will make use of the `forcats` package to work with categorical data. We will also be using the `plotly` package to improve plots and explore options for file input and output.

Please refer to [tidyr-exercise.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw05-shreeramsenthi/blob/master/forcats-exercise.md) for the exercise along with relevant code and figures.
